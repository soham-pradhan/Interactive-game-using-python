# Interactive-game-using-python(RISOAD)


Reduced Instruction Set Of A Doge
is an attempt to introduce programming at an
elementary level. The whole project is based on Python
and designed in Pygame. The project is in the form of a
game which has certain “commands” and each level
produces the user with a maze which needs to be
solved using the in game commands

 Inspired from the MSWLogo and a tribute to it, this game is aimed at introducing programming to school kids.
 The whole application is in the form of the game consisting of various chapters where each chapter is aimed to
introduce the user to a new in-game command which resembles a command used in an actual programming language.
This game was created using pygame, one of the modules of python.
 A login system was made for every user using Django framework and python programming was done by me.
