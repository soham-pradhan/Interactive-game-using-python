Reduced Instruction Set Of A Doge
is an attempt to introduce programming at an
elementary level. The whole project is based on Python
and designed in Pygame. The project is in the form of a
game which has certain “commands” and each level
produces the user with a maze which needs to be
solved using the in game commands.
